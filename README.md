# CSELEC3B_FELECIO
This project is a Python script that creates a digital gold medal with a basketball theme using the Pillow library. The script draws a gold medal with a basketball in the center and adds the text “Basketball Champion” along with the recipient’s name inside the medal.

To use this project, you need Python 3 and the Pillow library installed. You can install Pillow by running pip install pillow in your command line. After that, run the script by executing python medal.py. The script will display the medal image on your screen and save it as a file named basketball_champion_medal.png in your current folder.
